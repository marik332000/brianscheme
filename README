WHAT IT IS:

This is a simple attempt at building a metacircular scheme
implementation.

The C code implements a simple s-expression reader/writer, an
interpreter, garbage collection, foreign function interface, and a
simple virtual machine for an internal bytecode format.

The SCH code implements a base library, a compiler from scheme to the
bytecode format mentioned above, and a JIT assembler that utilizes
libjit (accessed via the FFI system) to allow the creation of new
primitive functions. The eventual goal is to write a bytecode ->
assembly translator so that we can compile the full language down to
the processor's machine code.
