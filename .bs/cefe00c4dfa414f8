title	"inline lambdas in the head position"
comments	("Code like:\n((lambda (x) (+ 1 x)) 1)\n\nis trivial to inline since no escape analysis is necessary. This\noptimization would significantly reduce the pressure on GC because\nit would prevent (let ..) from allocating a closure and would\nconvert many free variable references into formal variable references\nso we would reduce the number of environment frames necessary as\nwell.\n\n\n")
