title	"Segfaults on OpenBSD when loading images."
comments	("While everything else seems to work fine on OpenBSD, around 1 in 10
times bsch will segfault after loading an image. It looks like this
may have to do with the kernel picking mmap() locations that conflict
with malloc(). When mapping the image it may be mapping overtop
malloc()'s own structures. However, an experiment with choosing mmap()
locations seems to suggest this is untrue.
